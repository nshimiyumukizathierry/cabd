## 🌐 Production Deployment Steps

### 1. Environment Setup

**Vercel Environment Variables:**
\`\`\`env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here
\`\`\`

### 2. Deploy to Vercel

\`\`\`bash
# Connect your GitHub repo to Vercel
# Or deploy directly:
npm run build
vercel --prod
\`\`\`

### 3. Domain Configuration (Optional)

\`\`\`bash
# In Vercel dashboard:
# 1. Go to Settings > Domains
# 2. Add your custom domain
# 3. Configure DNS records
# 4. Enable SSL certificate
\`\`\`

### 4. Post-Deployment Verification

**Test these URLs in production:**
- `https://your-domain.com/` - Homepage with cars
- `https://your-domain.com/cars` - Car listings
- `https://your-domain.com/about` - Founder profiles
- `https://your-domain.com/admin/login` - Admin access
- `https://your-domain.com/admin/content` - Content dashboard

## 🔧 Performance Optimization

### Database Performance
\`\`\`sql
-- Monitor query performance
SELECT * FROM public.performance_stats;

-- Check slow queries (if needed)
SELECT query, mean_time, calls 
FROM pg_stat_statements 
ORDER BY mean_time DESC 
LIMIT 10;
\`\`\`

### Image Optimization
- Use WebP format when possible
- Compress images before upload
- Set appropriate image dimensions
- Enable browser caching

### Caching Strategy
\`\`\`javascript
// Add to next.config.js
module.exports = {
  images: {
    domains: ['your-supabase-project.supabase.co'],
    formats: ['image/webp', 'image/avif'],
  },
  headers: async () => [
    {
      source: '/api/:path*',
      headers: [
        { key: 'Cache-Control', value: 's-maxage=60, stale-while-revalidate' }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
\`\`\`

## 📊 Monitoring & Analytics

### Performance Monitoring
- Set up Vercel Analytics
- Monitor Core Web Vitals
- Track page load times
- Monitor error rates

### Business Metrics
- Track car views and inquiries
- Monitor admin usage
- Analyze popular car models
- Track conversion rates

### Database Monitoring
\`\`\`sql
-- Weekly maintenance query
SELECT 
  table_name,
  row_count,
  table_size,
  last_updated
FROM public.performance_stats;

-- Clean up old data
SELECT public.cleanup_old_cart_items();
\`\`\`

## 🔒 Security Best Practices

### Database Security
- ✅ RLS policies active on all tables
- ✅ Admin-only operations protected
- ✅ User data properly isolated
- ✅ No sensitive data in client code

### Application Security
- ✅ Input validation on all forms
- ✅ XSS protection enabled
- ✅ CSRF tokens in place
- ✅ Secure headers configured

### Storage Security
- ✅ File type restrictions enforced
- ✅ File size limits in place
- ✅ Public bucket only for images
- ✅ No executable files allowed

## 🚨 Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Production Issues

**Images Not Loading**
\`\`\`bash
# Check storage bucket configuration
# Verify CORS settings in Supabase
# Test direct image URLs
\`\`\`

**Database Connection Errors**
\`\`\`bash
# Verify environment variables
# Check Supabase project status
# Test with simple query in admin panel
\`\`\`

**Admin Access Issues**
\`\`\`bash
# Confirm user role in profiles table
# Check authentication flow
# Verify admin guard logic
\`\`\`

**Performance Issues**
\`\`\`sql
-- Check database performance
SELECT * FROM public.performance_stats;

-- Analyze slow queries
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM cars WHERE make ILIKE '%toyota%';
\`\`\`
