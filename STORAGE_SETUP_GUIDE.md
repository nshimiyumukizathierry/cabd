## ðŸ“‹ What the Fix Script Does

The `disable-rls-for-cars-bucket.sql` script:

1. **Creates/Updates Cars Bucket**: Ensures the bucket exists and is public
2. **Removes All Conflicting Policies**: Drops any existing policies that might conflict
3. **Creates One Simple Policy**: `Cars_bucket_public_access` that allows all operations
4. **Sets Proper Configuration**: 50MB file limit, image MIME types only

### The Single Policy Created:
\`\`\`sql
CREATE POLICY "Cars_bucket_public_access" ON storage.objects
FOR ALL
TO public
USING (bucket_id = 'cars')
WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'cars');
\`\`\`

This policy allows:
- âœ… **Public Read**: Anyone can view images
- âœ… **Public Upload**: Anyone can upload images (no auth required)
- âœ… **Public Update**: Anyone can replace images
- âœ… **Public Delete**: Anyone can delete images

## ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting

### Still Getting "Policy Already Exists"?
- The script handles this automatically by using `DROP POLICY IF EXISTS`
- If it still fails, manually delete policies in Dashboard first

### Still Getting "Row Level Security" Error?
- Run the `disable-rls-for-cars-bucket.sql` script again
- Check that the bucket is set to Public
- Verify the policy was created in Dashboard

### Images Not Displaying?
- Check browser console for 404 errors
- Verify bucket is public
- Test image URLs directly in browser

### Upload Fails Silently?
- Check browser console for detailed errors
- Verify file is under 50MB and is an image
- Try refreshing the page and testing again
